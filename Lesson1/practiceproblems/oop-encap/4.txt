In JavaScript, how does encapsulation differ from encapsulation in most other OO languages?

In other languages:
Encapsulation concerns hiding details of an object from code that uses the object.
An object should only expose the methods and properties that other objects need to uses
Javascript on the other hand does not directly provide the means to limit exposure* of methods and properties
There are ways to acheive a degree of access restrction.
